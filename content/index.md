WCAG 2.0 aims to be up to date and more technology neutral. Though web designers can choose either standard to follow, the WCAG 2.0 have been widely accepted as the definitive guidelines on how to create accessible websites. Governments are steadily adopting the WCAG 2.0 as the accessibility standard for their own websites. In 2012, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines were also published as an ISO/IEC standard: “ISO/IEC 40500:2012: Information technology – W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0”."

Understanding this overlap helps designers more efficiently meet both goals.<br/><br/>People with low bandwidth connections or older technology, people with low literacy or not fluent in the language, and new users."

             title : "TEXT RESIZING EXAMPLE"
             description: "An example of how accessibility overlaps with other issues and the different components of web accessibility is resizing text in websites.<br/><br/>For years, common browsers have provided settings for text sizes. However, it only worked if website developers coded relative text sizes (for example, % or em) instead of absolute sizes (e.g., pt), and didn’t put text in images. Also, most browsers offered only five text sizes. That meant that many users were not able to increase the text size sufficiently or at all for most websites.<br/><br/>Now, many browsers provide zoom functionality. With zoom, users can change the text size (no matter how website developers code it) and images within a significant range, often 10-1000 percent. (Still many users aren’t aware of this functionality or are stuck using browsers without it.)<br/><br/>Text resizing through zoom illustrates where accessibility can be provided through the browser. This is an example of the shared responsibility of web accessibility-what we call the “Essential Components of Web Accessibility.”<br/><br/>WAI covers these components with guidelines for “user agents” (such as browsers and media players) and for authoring tools (such as WYSIWYG editors, content management systems [CMS], blog software, and social networking sites).<br/><br/>Text resizing benefits others as well: older users often need to resize text, and when designing for mobile device users, the W3C Mobile Web Best Practices (MWBP) says, “Do not use pixel measures and do not use absolute units”"

             description: "These additional benefits are not always realized when designers use only limited standards. For example, current U.S. Section 508 web standards do not cover text resizing at all (and were published in 2000).<br/><br/>WAI’s accessibility standards are developed through the W3C process, with a goal of meeting the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally.<br/><br/>As many national governments update their accessibility policies and standards (including the U.S. Section 508 and 255), adopting WCAG 2.0 and WAI’s other accessibility standards provides international harmony."
